# jsprotect: protect data from crawlers

## Introduction

jsprotect is a simple library to help protect semi-confidential data, such as
addresses, e-mail addresses and telephone numbers from web crawlers and
scrapers.

jsprotect is not a foolproof guarantee that your e-mail address will not be
scraped, but can mitigate against more naive web crawlers.
